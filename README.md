CitiBike 


Analysis of Citibike trip data to determine impacts of Covid 19 on rider behavior, station traffic, and future fleet expectations.

Conducted in depth EDA to examine how rider behaviors have changed since the pre-covid era. 

Used Spatial Visualization applications to cluster and visualize popular stations and determine which stations have greatest effect on dock statons in expansion regions.

Created a time series analysis to determine monthly, weeekly, daily trends to predict current number of rides from stations.
